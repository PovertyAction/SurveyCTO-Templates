**Repeat that allows selection:**

Use this template when you have a roster (or repeat group), and then you have another repeat group in which you decide the order in which you will respond about the items in the first repeat group.  For example: You could first list all the household members (Carlos, Luisa and Jake) and then decide the member order based on their disponibility, not necessarily the same order you used in the beginning. 
 
 [repeat group] [roster] [select_one] [selection] [order] [calculate] [operational]

After the explanation, the template asks how many household members (or items) are in the repeat group

 Then it asks for the name of each item inside the repeat group

Once you have entered all the names, it allows you to select the member about you will respond first,

Example of a question about the selected member

Then you get to decide again about which member you will respond, except the previous selections are not shown.

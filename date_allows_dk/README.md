**Date that allows Doesn't Know:**

Use this template when you need to ask about a date but allowing the response “Doesn’t know/Refuse to answer”. The template has 3 ways of doing that: 1)Have a datetime field and a select_one for the “Doesn’t know/Refuse to answer” inside a field-list group. 2)Enter the day, month and year with integers, each allowing for -999 (Don’t know) and -888(Refuse to answer), and 3) Select the day, month and year from select_one that includes the “Doesn’t know/Refuse to answer” options.

[dates] [datetime] [don’t know] [refuse to answer] [field-list] [operational]

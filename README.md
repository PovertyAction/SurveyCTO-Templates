# SurveyCTO-Templates

In order to facilitate Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) during the COVID-19 pandemic, SurveyCTO created the [CATI Starter kit](https://support.surveycto.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044958494-Computer-Assisted-Telephone-Interviewing-CATI-starter-kit), a collection of resources and templates for creating a phone survey in SurveyCTO. Different projects at IPA have created templates based on the CATI Starter kit that address common issues encountered when conducting phone surveys.

## 1. Multiple Attempts Template
*Created by [Mehrab Ali](https://www.poverty-action.org/people/mehrab-ali)*

The Multiple Attempts Template allows enumerators to submit one form per day for each case instead of submitting one form for each attempt. For projects that are trying to limit their number of submissions and save money, this form will drastically lower the number of submissions while saving all information of attempts for each case. 

## 2. Mobilizer Survey Template
*Created by [Ishmail Azindoo Baako](https://www.poverty-action.org/people/ishmail-azindoo-baako)*

The Mobilizer Survey Template includes two xlsforms: the __Mobilizer Form__ and the __Phone Survey Form__. This template is useful when you do not have previous information about your survey sample. The mobilizer form is used by the mobilizer, who calls respondents to check respondents' availability for the phone survey as well as the language in which the respondent would prefer to be surveyed. Cases are then assigned to the phone survey form by matching them to enumerators who speak the same language.

**PHQ-A and GADD-7**

This version of PHQ-A and GADD-7 was designed for 13 / 14 year old male students in Colombia. 

The survey uses a visual layout with images as answer options. Please make sure to upload the clickable-svg.fieldplugin attachment and the .svg files to correctly deploy the questionnaire. If you want to use this template in a language different than spanish you might need to edit the .svg files

It was designed to be administered by enumerators holding tablets and taking participants through the questions. Participants should see the tablet the whole time. 

Enumerators are instructed to select the grey box at the bottom of the screen when participants decide not to answer.
Alternatively, survey can be implemented by handing the tablet to participants for them to fill in themselves. 

*This template has great contribution from Felipe Fajardo/ IPA Colombia*
